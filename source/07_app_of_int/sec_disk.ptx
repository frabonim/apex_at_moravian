      We can use this fact as the building block in finding volumes of a variety of shapes.
      </p>
    <p>
      Given an arbitrary solid, we can <em>approximate</em> its volume by cutting it into <m>n</m> thin slices. When the slices are thin, each slice can be approximated well by a general right cylinder. Thus the volume of each slice is approximately its cross-sectional area <times /> thickness. (These slices are the differential elements.)
    </p>
    <p>
      By orienting a solid along the <m>x</m>-axis, we can let <m>A(x_i)</m> represent the cross-sectional area
      of the <m>i^\text{ th }</m> slice, and let <m>\dx_i</m> represent the thickness of this slice (the thickness is a small change in <m>x</m>). The total volume of the solid is approximately:
      <md>
        <mrow>\text{ Volume }  \amp \approx \sum_{i=1}^n \Big[\text{ Area } \ \times\ \text{ thickness } \Big]</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp = \sum_{i=1}^n A(x_i)\dx_i.</mrow>
      </md>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      Recognize that this is a Riemann Sum. By taking a limit (as the thickness of the slices goes to 0) we can find the volume exactly.

          Find the volume of a pyramid with a square base of side length 10 in and a height of 5 in.
          </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          There are many ways to <q>orient</q> the pyramid along the <m>x</m>-axis; <xref ref="fig_disk0">Figure</xref> gives one such way, with the pointed top of the pyramid at the origin and the <m>x</m>-axis going through the center of the base.
        </p>
        <sidebyside width="47%">
          <figure xml:id="fig_disk0">

          </figure>
        </sidebyside>
        <p>
          Each cross section of the pyramid is a square; this is a sample differential element. To determine its area <m>A(x)</m>, we need to determine the side lengths of the square.
        </p>
        <p>
          When <m>x=5</m>, the square has side length 10; when <m>x=0</m>, the square has side length 0. Since the edges of the pyramid are lines, it is easy to figure that each cross-sectional square has side length <m>2x</m>, giving <m>A(x) = (2x)^2=4x^2</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          If one were to cut a slice out of the pyramid at <m>x=3</m>, as shown in <xref ref="fig_disk0a">Figure</xref>, one would have a shape with square bottom and top with sloped sides. If the slice were thin, both the bottom and top squares would have sides lengths of about 6, and thus the cross<ndash />sectional area of the bottom and top would be about <m>36</m>in<m>^2</m>. Letting <m>\Delta x_i</m> represent the thickness of the slice, the volume of this slice would then be about <m>36\Delta x_i</m>in<m>^3</m>.

          Cutting the pyramid into <m>n</m> slices divides the total volume into <m>n</m> equally<ndash />spaced smaller pieces, each with volume <m>(2x_i)^2\Delta x</m>, where <m>x_i</m> is the approximate location of the slice along the <m>x</m>-axis and <m>\Delta x</m> represents the thickness of each slice. One can approximate total volume of the pyramid by summing up the volumes of these slices:
          <me>
            \text{ Approximate volume }  = \sum_{i=1}^n (2x_i)^2\Delta x.
          </me>
        
        </p>
        <p>
          Taking the limit as <m>n\to\infty</m> gives the actual volume of the pyramid; recoginizing this sum as a Riemann Sum allows us to find the exact answer using a definite integral, matching the definite integral given by <xref ref="thm_volume_by_cross_section">Theorem</xref>.

        <p>
          We can check our work by consulting the general equation for the volume of a pyramid (see the back cover under <q>Volume of A General Cone</q>):

          Certainly, using this formula from geometry is faster than our new method, but the calculus<ndash />based method can be applied to much more than just cones.

      Start with a function <m>y=f(x)</m> from <m>x=a</m> to <m>x=b</m>. Revolving this curve about a horizontal axis creates a three-dimensional solid whose cross sections are disks (thin circles).

          A sketch can help us understand this problem.

          Slicing the solid into <m>n</m> equally<ndash />spaced slices, we can approximate the total volume by adding up the approximate volume of each slice:

        <p>
          Taking the limit of the above sum as <m>n\to\infty</m> gives the actual volume; recognizing this sum as a Riemann sum allows us to evaluate the limit with a definite integral, which matches the formula given in <xref ref="idea_disk_method">Key Idea</xref>:

      While <xref ref="idea_disk_method">Key Idea</xref> is given in terms of functions of <m>x</m>, the principle involved can be applied to functions of <m>y</m> when the axis of rotation is vertical, not horizontal. We demonstrate this in the next example.

          Find the volume of the solid formed by revolving the curve <m>y=1/x</m>, from <m>x=1</m> to <m>x=2</m>, about the <m>y</m>-axis.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          Since the axis of rotation is vertical, we need to convert the function into a function of <m>y</m> and convert the <m>x</m>-bounds to <m>y</m>-bounds. Since <m>y=1/x</m> defines the curve, we rewrite it as <m>x=1/y</m>. The bound <m>x=1</m> corresponds to the <m>y</m>-bound <m>y=1</m>, and the bound <m>x=2</m> corresponds to the <m>y</m>-bound <m>y=1/2</m>.

        <p>
          Thus we are rotating the curve <m>x=1/y</m>, from <m>y=1/2</m> to <m>y=1</m> about the <m>y</m>-axis to form a solid. The curve and sample differential element are sketched in <xref ref="fig_disk2a">Figure</xref>, with a full sketch of the solid in <xref ref="fig_disk2b">Figure</xref>.

      One can generate a solid of revolution with a hole in the middle by revolving a region about an axis. Consider <xref ref="fig_washeridea1a">Figure</xref>, where a region is sketched along with a dashed, horizontal axis of rotation. By rotating the region about the axis, a solid is formed as sketched in <xref ref="fig_washeridea1b">Figure</xref>.

          The inside radius is formed by the line connecting <m>(1,1)</m> and <m>(2,3)</m>. The equation of this line is <m>y=2x-1</m>, but we need to refer to it as a function of <m>y</m>. Solving for <m>x</m> gives <m>r(y) = \frac12(y+1)</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          We integrate over the <m>y</m>-bounds of <m>y=1</m> to <m>y=3</m>. Thus the volume is
          <md>
            <mrow>V 	\amp =	\pi\int_1^3\Big(2^2 - \big(\frac12(y+1)\big)^2\Big)\ dy</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp =	\pi\int_1^3\Big(-\frac14y^2-\frac12y+\frac{15}4\Big)\ dy</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp = 	\pi\Big[-\frac1{12}y^3-\frac14y^2+\frac{15}4y\Big]\Big|_1^3</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp = \frac{10}3\pi \approx 10.47\ \text{ units } ^3.</mrow>

      This section introduced a new application of the definite integral. Our default view of the definite integral is that it gives <q>the area under the curve.</q> However, we can establish definite integrals that represent other quantities; in this section, we computed volume.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ultimate goal of this section is not to compute volumes of solids. That can be useful, but what is more useful is the understanding of this basic principle of integral calculus, outlined in <xref ref="idea_app_of_defint">Key Idea</xref>: to find the exact value of some quantity,
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          we start with an approximation (in this section, slice the solid and approximate the volume of each slice),
          </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          then make the approximation better by refining our original approximation (i.e., use more slices),
          </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          then use limits to establish a definite integral which gives the exact value.
          </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We practice this principle in the next section where we find volumes by slicing solids in a different way.
