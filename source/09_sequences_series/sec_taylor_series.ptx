  <introduction>
    <p>
      In <xref ref="sec_power_series">Section</xref>, we showed how certain functions can be represented by a power series function. <xref ref="sec_taylor_poly">In</xref>, we showed how we can approximate functions with polynomials, given that enough derivative information is available. In this section we combine these concepts: if a function <m>f(x)</m> is infinitely differentiable, we show how to represent it with a power series function.

      The difference between a Taylor polynomial and a Taylor series is the former is a polynomial, containing only a finite number of terms, whereas the latter is a series, a summation of an infinite set of terms. When creating the Taylor polynomial of degree <m>n</m> for a function <m>f(x)</m> at <m>x=c</m>, we needed to evaluate <m>f</m>, and the first <m>n</m> derivatives of <m>f</m>, at <m>x=c</m>. When creating the Taylor series of <m>f</m>, it helps to find a pattern that describes the <m>n^\text{ th }</m> derivative of <m>f</m> at <m>x=c</m>. We demonstrate this in the next two examples.

          We can go further and write this as a summation. Since we only need the terms where the power of <m>x</m> is even, we write the power series in terms of <m>x^{2n}</m>:

            \infser[0] (-1)^{n}\frac{x^{2n}}{(2n)!}.

      It is natural to assume that a function is equal to its Taylor series on the series' interval of convergence, but this is not the case. In order to properly establish equality, one must use <xref ref="thm_function_series_equality">Theorem</xref>. This is a bit disappointing, as we developed beautiful techniques for determining the interval of convergence of a power series, and proving that <m>R_n(x)\to 0</m> can be cumbersome as it deals with high order derivatives of the function.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is good news. A function <m>f(x)</m> that is equal to its Taylor series, centered at any point the domain of <m>f(x)</m>, is said to be an <em>analytic function</em>,<idx><h>analytic function</h></idx> and most, if not all, functions that we encounter within this course are analytic functions. Generally speaking, any function that one creates with elementary functions (polynomials, exponentials, trigonometric functions, etc.) that is not piecewise defined is probably analytic. For most functions, we assume the function is equal to its Taylor series on the series' interval of convergence and only use <xref ref="thm_function_series_equality">Theorem</xref> when we suspect something may not work as expected.

        <p>
          Find the Maclaurin series of <m>f(x) = (1+x)^k</m>, <m>k\neq 0</m>.

      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          When <m>k</m> is a positive integer, the Maclaurin series is finite. For instance, when <m>k=4</m>, we have
          <me>
            f(x) = (1+x)^4 = 1+4x+6x^2+4x^3+x^4.
          </me>
        
        </p>
        <p>
          The coefficients of <m>x</m> when <m>k</m> is a positive integer are known as the <em>binomial coefficients</em>, giving the series we are developing its name.
        </p>
        <p>
          When <m>k=1/2</m>, we have <m>f(x) = \sqrt{1+x}</m>. Knowing a series representation of this function would give a useful way of approximating <m>\sqrt{1.3}</m>, for instance.
        </p>
        <p>
          To develop the Maclaurin series for <m>f(x) = (1+x)^k</m> for any value of <m>k\neq0</m>, we consider the derivatives of <m>f</m> evaluated at <m>x=0</m>:
        </p>
        <md>
          <mrow>f(x) \amp = (1+x)^k \amp  f(0) \amp = 1</mrow>

          It is important to determine the interval of convergence of this series. With
          <me>
            a_n = \frac{k(k-1)\cdots\big(k-(n-1)\big)}{n!}x^n,
          </me>
          we apply the Ratio Test:
          <md>
            <mrow>\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{\abs{a_{n+1}}}{\abs{a_n}}\amp =\lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{\abs{\frac{k(k-1)\cdots(k-n)}{(n+1)!}x^{n+1}}}{\abs{\frac{k(k-1)\cdots\big(k-(n-1)\big)}{n!}x^n}}</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp =\lim_{n\to\infty} \abs{\frac{k-n}{n}x}</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp = \abs{x}.</mrow>
          </md>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          The series converges absolutely when the limit of the Ratio Test is less than 1; therefore, we have absolute convergence when <m>\abs{x}\lt 1</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          While outside the scope of this text, the interval of convergence depends on the value of <m>k</m>. When <m>k&gt;0</m>, the interval of convergence is <m>[-1,1]</m>. When <m>-1\lt k\lt 0</m>, the interval of convergence is <m>[-1,1)</m>. If <m>k\leq -1</m>, the interval of convergence is <m>(-1,1)</m>.

      We learned that Taylor polynomials offer a way of approximating a <q>difficult to compute</q> function with a polynomial. Taylor series offer a way of exactly representing a function with a series. One probably can see the use of a good approximation; is there any use of representing a function exactly as a series?
    </p>
    <p>
      While we should not overlook the mathematical beauty of Taylor series (which is reason enough to study them), there are practical uses as well. They provide a valuable tool for solving a variety of problems, including problems relating to integration and differential equations.
      </p>
    <p>
      In <xref ref="idea_common_taylor">Key Idea</xref> (on the following page) we give a table of the Taylor series of a number of common functions. We then give a theorem about the <q>algebra of power series,</q> that is, how we can combine power series to create power series of new functions. This allows us to find the Taylor series of functions like <m>f(x) = e^x\cos(x)</m> by knowing the Taylor series of <m>e^x</m> and <m>\cos(x)</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before we investigate combining functions, consider the Taylor series for the arctangent function (see <xref ref="idea_common_taylor">Key Idea</xref>). Knowing that <m>\tan^{-1}(1) = \pi/4</m>, we can use this series to approximate the value of <m>\pi</m>:
      <md>
        <mrow>\frac{\pi}4 \amp = \tan^{-1}(1) = 1-\frac13+\frac15-\frac17+\frac19-\cdots</mrow>
        <mrow>\pi \amp = 4\left(1-\frac13+\frac15-\frac17+\frac19-\cdots\right)</mrow>
      </md>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, this particular expansion of <m>\pi</m> converges very slowly. The first
      100 terms approximate <m>\pi</m> as <m>3.13159</m>, which is not particularly good.

          We use <xref ref="thm_calc_power_series">Theorem</xref> to integrate:
          <me>
            \int e^{-x^2}\ dx = C + x - \frac{x^3}{3}+\frac{x^5}{5\cdot2!}-\frac{x^7}{7\cdot3!}+\cdots +(-1)^n\frac{x^{2n+1}}{(2n+1)n!}+\cdots

          This <em>is</em> the antiderivative of <m>e^{-x^2}</m>; while we can write it out as a series, we cannot write it out in terms of elementary functions. We can evaluate the definite integral <m>\ds \int_0^1e^{-x^2}\ dx</m> using this antiderivative; substituting 1 and 0 for <m>x</m> and subtracting gives
          <me>
            \int_0^1e^{-x^2}\ dx = 1-\frac{1}{3}+\frac{1}{5\cdot 2!}-\frac{1}{7\cdot3!} + \frac{1}{9\cdot4!}\cdots.

          Summing the 5 terms shown above give the approximation of <m>0.74749</m>. Since this is an alternating series, we can use the Alternating Series Approximation Theorem, (<xref ref="thm_alt_series_approx">Theorem</xref>), to determine how accurate this approximation is. The next term of the series is <m>1/(11\cdot5!) \approx 0.00075758</m>. Thus we know our approximation is within <m>0.00075758</m> of the actual value of the integral. This is arguably much less work than using Simpson's Rule to approximate the value of the integral.

          We found the first 5 terms of the power series solution to this differential equation in <xref ref="ex_ps5">Example</xref> in <xref ref="sec_power_series">Section</xref>. These are:
          <me>
            a_0=1, a_1 = 2, a_2 = \frac42=2, a_3=\frac{8}{2\cdot3}=\frac43, a_4=\frac{16}{2\cdot3\cdot4} = \frac23.

        <p>
          We include the <q>unsimplified</q> expressions for the coefficients found in <xref ref="ex_ps5">Example</xref> as we are looking for a pattern. It can be shown that <m>a_n = 2^n/n!</m>. Thus the solution, written as a power series, is
          <me>
            y = \infser[0] \frac{2^n}{n!}x^n = \infser[0] \frac{(2x)^n}{n!}.

          Using <xref ref="idea_common_taylor">Key Idea</xref> and <xref ref="thm_series_alg">Theorem</xref>, we recognize <m>f(x) = e^{2x}</m>:
          <me>
            e^x = \infser[0] \frac{x^n}{n!} \qquad \Rightarrow \qquad e^{2x} = \infser[0] \frac{(2x)^n}{n!}.

      Finding a pattern in the coefficients that match the series expansion of a known function, such as those shown in <xref ref="idea_common_taylor">Key Idea</xref>, can be difficult. What if the coefficients in the previous example were given in their reduced form; how could we still recover the function <m>y=e^{2x}</m>?

      Suppose that all we know is that
      <me>
        a_0=1, a_1=2, a_2=2, a_3=\frac43, a_4=\frac23.

      <xref ref="def_taylor_series">Definition</xref> states that each term of the Taylor expansion of a function includes an <m>n!</m>. This allows us to say that
      <me>
        a_2=2=\frac{b_2}{2!}, a_3 = \frac43=\frac{b_3}{3!}, \text{ and }  a_4 = \frac23=\frac{b_4}{4!}
      </me>
      for some values <m>b_2</m>, <m>b_3</m> and <m>b_4</m>.
      Solving for these values, we see that <m>b_2=4</m>, <m>b_3 = 8</m> and <m>b_4=16</m>. That is, we are recovering the pattern we had previously seen, allowing us to write

        <mrow>f(x) = \infser[0] a_nx^n \amp = \infser[0] \frac{b_n}{n!}x^n</mrow>

      From here it is easier to recognize that the series is describing an exponential function.

    <p>
      There are simpler, more direct ways of solving the differential equation <m>y' = 2y</m>. We applied power series techniques to this equation to demonstrate its utility, and went on to show how <em>sometimes</em> we are able to recover the solution in terms of elementary functions using the theory of Taylor series. Most differential equations faced in real scientific and engineering situations are much more complicated than this one, but power series can offer a valuable tool in finding, or at least approximating, the solution.

      This chapter introduced sequences, which are ordered lists of numbers, followed by series, wherein we add up the terms of a sequence. We quickly saw that such sums do not always add up to <q>infinity,</q> but rather converge. We studied tests for convergence, then ended the chapter with a formal way of defining functions based on series. Such <q>series<ndash />defined functions</q> are a valuable tool in solving a number of different problems throughout science and engineering.

      Coming in the next chapters are new ways of defining curves in the plane apart from using functions of the form <m>y=f(x)</m>. Curves created by these new methods can be beautiful, useful, and important.
