  <title>The Graphical Behavior of Functions</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>Our study of limits led to continuous functions, which is a certain class of functions that behave in a particularly nice way. Limits then gave us an even nicer class of functions, functions that are differentiable.</p>

    <p>This chapter explores many of the ways we can take advantage of the information that continuous and differentiable functions provide.</p>
