    <exercise>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Explain how a line integral can be used to find the area under a curve.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <answer>
        <p>
          When <m>C</m> is a curve in the plane and <m>f</m> is a surface defined over <m>C</m>,
          then <m>\int_C f(s)\, ds</m> describes the area under the spatial curve that lies on <m>f</m>,
          over <m>C</m>.
        </p>
      </answer>

    <exercise>
      <statement>
        <p>
          How does the evaluation of a line integral given as
          <m>\int_C f(s)\, ds</m> differ from a line integral given as <m>\oint_C f(s)\, ds</m>?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <answer>
        <p>
          The evaluation is the same.
          The <m>\oint</m> notation signifies that the curve <m>C</m> is a closed curve,
          though the evaluation is the same.
        </p>

    <exercise>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Why are most line integrals evaluated using <xref ref="thm_line1">Key Idea</xref> instead of <q>directly</q>
          as <m>\int_C f(s)\, ds</m>?
        </p>
      </statement>
      <answer>
        <p>
          The variable <m>s</m> denotes the arc-length parameter,
          which is generally difficult to use.
          The Key Idea allows one to parametrize a curve using another,
          ideally easier-to-use, parameter.
