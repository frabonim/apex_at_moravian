          <p>
            Two line integrals need to be computed to compute <m>\oint_C \vec F\cdot \vec n\, ds</m>.
            Along the parabola, the line integral has value <m>159/20</m>.
            Along the line, the line integral has value <m>6</m>.
            Together, the total value is <m>279/20</m>.
          </p>

          <p>
            The double integral of <m>\divv\vec F</m> over <m>R</m> also has value <m>279/20</m>.
