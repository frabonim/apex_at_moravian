  <title>Continuity</title>
  <p>
    As we have studied limits, we have gained the intuition that limits measure <q>where a function is heading.</q> That is, if <m>\lim\limits_{x\to 1} f(x) = 3</m>, then as <m>x</m> is close to <m>1</m>, <m>f(x)</m> is close to <m>3</m>. We have seen, though, that this is not necessarily a good indicator of what <m>f(1)</m> actually is. This can be problematic; functions can tend to one value but attain another. This section focuses on functions that <em>do not</em> exhibit such behavior.

    A useful way to establish whether or not a function <m>f</m> is continuous at <m>c</m> is to verify the following three things:<ol>
      <li><p><m>\lim\limits_{x\to c} f(x)</m> exists,</p></li>

      <li><p><m>f(c)</m> is defined, and</p></li>

      <li><p><m>\lim\limits_{x\to c} f(x) = f(c)</m>.</p></li>

      <p>
        We conclude that <m>f</m> is continuous everywhere except at integer values of <m>c</m>.

    Our definition of continuity on an interval specifies the interval is an open interval. We can extend the definition of continuity to closed intervals by considering the appropriate one-sided limits at the endpoints.

    Continuity is inherently tied to the properties of limits. Because of this, the properties of limits found in <xref ref="thm_limit_algebra">Theorems</xref> and <xref ref="thm_poly_rat" /> apply to continuity as well. Further, now knowing the definition of continuity we can re-read <xref ref="thm_lim_continuous">Theorem</xref> as giving a list of functions that are continuous on their domains. The following theorem states how continuous functions can be combined to form other continuous functions, followed by a theorem which formally lists functions that we know are continuous on their domains.

              The range of <m>y=\ln(x)</m> is <m>(-\infty,\infty)</m> which includes invalid input for <m>\sqrt{\phantom{x}}</m>. We must restrict the domain to <m>I=[1,\infty)</m> in order to have <m>\ln(x)</m> produce output in <m>J=[0,\infty)</m>, which can then be used as valid input into <m>\sqrt{\phantom{x}}</m>. Since <m>\ln(\phantom{x})</m> is continuous on <m>I</m> and <m>\sqrt{\phantom{x}}</m> is continuous on <m>J</m>, <m>G(x) = \sqrt{\ln(x)}</m> is continuos on <m>I=[1,\infty)</m>.

    A common way of thinking of a continuous function is that <q>its graph can be sketched without lifting your pencil.</q> That is, its graph forms a <q>continuous</q> curve, without holes, breaks or jumps. This pseudo-definition glosses over some of the finer points of continuity that are beyond the scope of this text. Very strange functions are continuous that one would be hard pressed to actually sketch by hand.
  </p>
  <p>
    However this intuitive notion of continuity does help us understand another important concept as follows. Suppose <m>f</m> is defined on <m>[1,2]</m>, and <m>f(1) = -10</m> and <m>f(2) = 5</m>. If <m>f</m> is continuous on <m>[1,2]</m> (i.e., its graph can be sketched as a continuous curve from <m>(1,-10)</m> to <m>(2,5)</m>) then we know intuitively that somewhere on the interval <m>[1,2]</m> <m>f</m> must be equal to <m>-9</m>, and <m>-8</m>, and <m>-7,-6,\ldots,0,1/2</m>, etc. In short, <m>f</m> takes on all <em>intermediate</em> values between <m>-10</m> and <m>5</m>. It may take on more values; <m>f</m> may actually equal <m>6</m> at some time, for instance, but we are guaranteed all values between <m>-10</m> and <m>5</m>.

    While this notion seems intuitive, it is not trivial to prove and its importance is profound. Therefore the concept is stated in the form of a theorem.
    </p>
  <theorem xml:id="thm_IVT">
    <title>Intermediate Value Theorem</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>f</m> be a continuous function on <m>[a,b]</m> and, without loss of generality, let <m>f(a) \lt  f(b)</m>. Then for every value <m>y</m>, where <m>f(a) \lt  y \lt  f(b)</m>, there is a value <m>c</m> in <m>[a,b]</m> such that <m>f(c) = y</m>. <idx><h>Intermediate Value Theorem</h></idx>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>
  <p>
    One important application of the <xref ref="thm_IVT" /> is root finding. Given a function <m>f</m>, we are often interested in finding values of <m>x</m> where <m>f(x) = 0</m>. These roots may be very difficult to find exactly. Good approximations can be found through successive applications of this theorem. Suppose through direct computation we find that <m>f(a) \lt 0</m> and <m>f(b)&gt;0</m>, where <m>a\lt b</m>. The <xref ref="thm_IVT" /> states that there is a <m>c</m> in <m>[a,b]</m> such that <m>f(c) = 0</m>. The theorem does not give us any clue as to where that value is in the interval <m>[a,b]</m>, just that it exists.
  </p>
  <p>
    There is a technique that produces a good approximation of <m>c</m>. Let <m>d</m> be the midpoint of the interval <m>[a,b]</m>, with <m>f(a) \lt 0</m> and <m>f(b) \gt 0</m> and consider <m>f(d)</m>. There are three possibilities:<ol>
      <li>
        <p><m>f(d) = 0</m> <mdash /> we got lucky and stumbled on the actual value. We stop as we found a root.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p><m>f(d) \lt 0</m>. Then we know there is a root of <m>f</m> on the interval <m>[d,b]</m> <mdash /> we have halved the size of our interval, hence are closer to a good approximation of the root.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p><m>f(d) &gt;0</m>. Then we know there is a root of <m>f</m> on the interval <m>[a,d]</m> <mdash /> again,we have halved the size of our interval, hence are closer to a good approximation of the root.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </p>
  <p>
    Successively applying this technique is called the <term>Bisection Method</term> <idx><h>Bisection Method</h></idx> of root finding. We continue until the interval is sufficiently small. We demonstrate this in the following example.
  </p>

        Consider the graph of <m>f(x) = x-\cos(x)</m>, shown in <xref ref="fig_xminuscosx">Figure</xref>. It is clear that the graph crosses the <m>x</m>-axis somewhere near <m>x=0.8</m>. To start the Bisection Method, pick an interval that contains <m>0.8</m>. We choose <m>[0.7,0.9]</m>. Note that all we care about are signs of <m>f(x)</m>, not their actual value, so this is all we display.

        Notice that in the 12th iteration we have the endpoints of the interval each starting with <m>0.739</m>. Thus we have narrowed the zero down to an accuracy of the first three places after the decimal. Using a computer, we have<me>f(0.7390) = -0.00014,  f(0.7391) = 0.000024.</me>
      </p>
      <p>
        Either endpoint of the interval gives a good approximation of where <m>f</m> is <m>0</m>. The <xref ref="thm_IVT" /> states that the actual zero is still within this interval. While we do not know its exact value, we know it starts with <m>0.739</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        This type of exercise is rarely done by hand. Rather, it is simple to program a computer to run such an algorithm and stop when the endpoints differ by a preset small amount. One of the authors did write such a program and found the zero of <m>f</m> to be <m>0.7390851332</m> , accurate to <m>10</m> places after the decimal. While it took a few minutes to write the program, it took less than a thousandth of a second for the program to run the necessary <m>35</m> iterations. In less than <m>8</m> hundredths of a second, the zero was calculated to <m>100</m> decimal places (with less than <m>200</m> iterations).

    It is a simple matter to extend the Bisection Method to solve problems similar to <q>Find <m>x</m>, where <m>f(x) = 0</m>.</q> For instance, we can find <m>x</m>, where <m>f(x) = 1</m>. It actually works very well to define a new function <m>g</m> where <m>g(x) = f(x) - 1</m>. Then use the Bisection Method to solve <m>g(x)=0</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Similarly, given two functions <m>f</m> and <m>g</m>, we can use the Bisection Method to solve <m>f(x) = g(x)</m>. Once again, create a new function <m>h</m> where <m>h(x) = f(x)-g(x)</m> and solve <m>h(x) = 0</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    In <xref ref="sec_newton">Section</xref> another equation solving method will be introduced, called Newton's Method. In many cases, Newton's Method is much faster. It relies on more advanced mathematics, though, so we will wait before introducing it.
  </p>
  <p>
    This section formally defined what it means to be a continuous function. <q>Most</q> functions that we deal with are continuous, so often it feels odd to have to formally define this concept. Regardless, it is important, and forms the basis of the next chapter.
