  <title>Implicit Differentiation</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      In the previous sections we learned to find the derivative, <m>\lz{y}{x}</m>, or <m>y'</m>, when <m>y</m> is given <em>explicitly</em> as a function of <m>x</m>. That is, if we know <m>y=f(x)</m> for some function <m>f</m>, we can find <m>y'</m>. For example, given <m>y=3x^2-7</m>, we can easily find <m>y'=6x</m>. (Here we explicitly state how <m>y</m> depends on <m>x</m>. Knowing <m>x</m>, we can directly find <m>y</m>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes the relationship between <m>y</m> and <m>x</m> is not explicit; rather, it is <em>implicit</em>. For instance, we might know that <m>x^2-y=4</m>. This equality defines a relationship between <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>; if we know <m>x</m>, we could figure out <m>y</m>. Can we still find <m>y'</m>? In this case, sure; we solve for <m>y</m> to get <m>y=x^2-4</m> (hence we now know <m>y</m> explicitly) and then differentiate to get <m>y'=2x</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes the <em>implicit</em> relationship between <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> is complicated. Suppose we are given <m>\sin(y)+y^3=6-x^3</m>. A graph of this implicit relationship is given in <xref ref="fig_implicit1">Figure</xref>. In this case there is absolutely no way to solve for <m>y</m> in terms of elementary functions. The surprising thing is, however, that we can still find <m>y'</m> via a process known as <term>implicit differentiation</term>.<idx><h>implicit differentiation</h></idx><idx><h>derivative</h>implicit</idx>

      Implicit differentiation is a technique based on the <xref text="title" ref="thm_chain_rule" /> that is used to find a derivative when the relationship between the variables is given implicitly rather than explicitly (solved for one variable in terms of the other).
    </p>
    <p>
      We begin by reviewing the Chain Rule. Let <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> be functions of <m>x</m>. Then
      <me>
        \lzoo{x}{f(g(x))} = \fp(g(x))\cdot g'(x).
      </me>
    
    </p>
    <p>
      Suppose now that <m>y=g(x)</m>. We can rewrite the above as
      <mdn>
        <mrow xml:id="eq_implicit1">\lzoo{x}{f(y)}\amp=\fp(y)\cdot y',\amp\amp\text{ or }\amp\lzoo{x}{f(y)}\amp=\fp(y)\cdot\lz{y}{x}.</mrow>
      </mdn>
    
    </p>
    <p>
      These equations look strange; the key concept to learn here is that we can find <m>y'</m> even if we don't exactly know how <m>y</m> and <m>x</m> relate.
    </p>
    <p>
      We demonstrate this process in the following example.
      </p>
    <example xml:id="ex_implicit1">
      <title>Using Implicit Differentiation</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Find <m>y'</m> given that <m>\sin(y) + y^3=6-x^3</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          We start by taking the derivative of both sides (thus maintaining the equality.) We have:
          <me>
            \lzoo{x}{\sin(y) + y^3}=\lzoo{x}{6-x^3}.
          </me>
        
        </p>
        <p>
          The right hand side is easy; it returns <m>-3x^2</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The left hand side requires more consideration. We take the derivative term-by-term. Using the technique derived from <xref ref="eq_implicit1">Equation</xref> above, we can see that
          <me>
            \lzoo{x}{\sin(y)} = \cos(y) \cdot y'.
          </me>
        
        </p>
        <p>
          We apply the same process to the <m>y^3</m> term.
          <me>
            \lzoo{x}{y^3} = \lzoo{x}{(y)^3} = 3(y)^2\cdot y'.
          </me>
        
        </p>
        <p>
          Putting this together with the right hand side, we have
          <me>
            \cos(y)y'+3y^2y' = -3x^2.
          </me>
        
        </p>
        <p>
          Now solve for <m>y'</m>. It's important to treat <m>y'</m> as an algebraically independent variable from <m>y</m> and <m>x</m>.
          <md>
            <mrow>\cos(y)y'+3y^2y'\amp = -3x^2</mrow>
            <mrow>\left(\cos(y) +3y^2\right)y' \amp =-3x^2</mrow>
            <mrow>y'\amp =\frac{-3x^2}{\cos(y) +3y^2}</mrow>
          </md>
          
        </p>
        <p>
          This equation for <m>y'</m> probably seems unusual for it contains both <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> terms. How is it to be used? We'll address that next.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>
    <p>
      Implicit functions are generally harder to deal with than explicit functions. With an explicit function, given an <m>x</m> value, we have an explicit formula for computing the corresponding <m>y</m> value. With an implicit function, one often has to find <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> values <em>at the same time</em> that satisfy the equation. It is much easier to demonstrate that a given point satisfies the equation than to actually find such a point.
    </p>
    <p>
      For instance, we can affirm easily that the point <m>\left(\sqrt[3]{6},0\right)</m> lies on the graph of the implicit function <m>\sin(y) + y^3=6-x^3</m>. Plugging in <m>0</m> for <m>y</m>, we see the left hand side is <m>0</m>. Setting <m>x=\sqrt[3]6</m>, we see the right hand side is also <m>0</m>; the equation is satisfied. The following example finds the equation of the tangent line to this function at this point.
    </p>
    <example xml:id="ex_implicit2">
      <title>Using Implicit Differentiation to find a Tangent Line</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Find the equation of the line tangent to the curve of the implicitly defined function <m>\sin(y) + y^3=6-x^3</m> at the point <m>\left(\sqrt[3]6,0\right)</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          In <xref ref="ex_implicit1">Example</xref> we found that
          <me>
            y' = \frac{-3x^2}{\cos(y) +3y^2}.
          </me>
        
        </p>
        <p>
          We find the slope of the tangent line at the point <m>\left(\sqrt[3]6,0\right)</m> by substituting <m>\sqrt[3]6</m> for <m>x</m> and <m>0</m> for <m>y</m>. Thus at the point <m>\left(\sqrt[3]6,0\right)</m>, we have the slope as
          <me>
            y' = \frac{-3\left(\sqrt[3]{6}\right)^2}{\cos(0) + 3\cdot0^2} = \frac{-3\sqrt[3]{36}}{1} \approx -9.91.
          </me>
        
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore the equation of the tangent line to the implicitly defined function <m>\sin(y) + y^3=6-x^3</m> at the point <m>\left(\sqrt[3]{6},0\right)</m> is
          <me>
            y = -3\sqrt[3]{36}\left(x-\sqrt[3]{6}\right)+0 \approx -9.91x+18.
          </me>
        
        </p>
        <p>

      This suggests a general method for implicit differentiation. For the steps below assume <m>y</m> is a function of <m>x</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            Take the derivative of each term in the equation.  Treat the <m>x</m> terms like normal.  When taking the derivatives of <m>y</m> terms, the usual rules apply except that, because of the <xref ref="thm_chain_rule">Chain Rule</xref>, we need to multiply each term by <m>y'</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Get all the <m>y'</m> terms on one side of the equal sign and put the remaining terms on the other side.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Factor out <m>y'</m>;  solve for <m>y'</m> by dividing.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
      (Practical Note: when working by hand, it may be beneficial to use the symbol <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m> instead of <m>y'</m>, as the latter can be easily confused for <m>y</m> or <m>y^1</m>.)
    </p>
    <example xml:id="ex_implicit3">
      <title>Using Implicit Differentiation</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Given the implicitly defined function <m>y^3+x^2y^4=1+2x</m>, find <m>y'</m>.

          We will take the implicit derivatives term-by-term. The derivative of <m>y^3</m> is <m>3y^2y'</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The second term, <m>x^2y^4</m>, is a little tricky. It requires the <xref text="title" ref="thm_ProductRule" /> as it is the product of two functions of <m>x</m>: <m>x^2</m> and <m>y^4</m>. Its derivative is <m>x^2(4y^3y') + 2xy^4</m>. The first part of this expression requires a <m>y'</m> because we are taking the derivative of a <m>y</m> term. The second part does not require it because we are taking the derivative of <m>x^2</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The derivative of the right hand side is easily found to be <m>2</m>. In all, we get:
          <me>
            3y^2y' + 4x^2y^3y' + 2xy^4 = 2.
          </me>
        
        </p>
        <p>
          Move terms around so that the left side consists only of the <m>y'</m> terms and the right side consists of all the other terms:
          <me>
            3y^2y' + 4x^2y^3y' = 2-2xy^4.
          </me>
        
        </p>
        <p>
          Factor out <m>y'</m> from the left side and solve to get
          <me>
            y' = \frac{2-2xy^4}{3y^2+4x^2y^3}.
          </me>

        <p>
          To confirm the validity of our work, let's find the equation of a tangent line to this function at a point. It is easy to confirm that the point <m>(0,1)</m> lies on the graph of this function. At this point, <m>y' = 2/3</m>. So the equation of the tangent line is <m>y = 2/3(x-0)+1</m>. The function and its tangent line are graphed in <xref ref="fig_implicit4">Figure</xref>.

          Notice how our curve looks much different than for functions we have seen. For one, it fails the vertical line test, and so the complete curve is not truly representing <m>y</m> as a function of <m>x</m>. But when we indicate we are interested in the derivative at <m>(0,1)</m>, we are indicating that we want the function defined by the small portion of the curve that passes through <m>(0,1)</m>, and that small portion does pass the vertical line test. Such functions are important in many areas of mathematics, so developing tools to deal with them is also important.

        </p>
        <p>
          From here we can safely move around terms to get the following:
          <me>
            2x^2y\cos\mathopen{}\left(x^2y^2\right)\mathclose{}y' + 3y^2y' - y' = 1 - 2xy^2\cos\mathopen{}\left(x^2y^2\right)\mathclose{}.
          </me>
        
        </p>
        <p>
          Then we can solve for <m>y'</m> to get
          <me>
            y' = \frac{1 - 2xy^2\cos\mathopen{}\left(x^2y^2\right)\mathclose{}}{2x^2y\cos\mathopen{}\left(x^2y^2\right)\mathclose{}+3y^2-1}.

          This is a clever formula. Recall that the slope of the line through the origin and the point <m>(x,y)</m> on the circle will be <m>y/x</m>.

      This section has shown how to find the derivatives of implicitly defined functions, whose graphs include a wide variety of interesting and unusual shapes. Implicit differentiation can also be used to further our understanding of <q>regular</q> differentiation.
    </p>
    <p>
      One hole in our current understanding of derivatives is this: what is the derivative of the square root function? That is,
      <me>
        \lzoo{x}{\sqrt{x}} = \lzoo{x}{x^{1/2}} = \text{?}
      </me>
    
    </p>
    <p>
      We allude to a possible solution, as we can write the square root function as a power function with a rational (or, fractional) power. We are then tempted to apply the <xref text="title" ref="thm_PowerRule" /> and obtain
      <me>
        \lzoo{x^{1/2}} = \frac{1}{2}x^{-1/2} = \frac{1}{2\sqrt{x}}.
      </me>
    
    </p>
    <p>
      The trouble with this is that the <xref text="title" ref="thm_PowerRule" /> was initially defined only for positive integer powers, <m>n&gt;0</m>. While we did not justify this at the time, generally the <xref text="title" ref="thm_PowerRule" /> is proved using something called the Binomial Theorem, which deals only with positive integers. The <xref text="title" ref="thm_QuotientRule" /> allowed us to extend the <xref text="title" ref="thm_PowerRule" /> to negative integer powers. Implicit Differentiation allows us to extend the <xref text="title" ref="thm_PowerRule" /> to rational powers, as shown below.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let <m>y = x^{m/n}</m>, where <m>m</m> and <m>n</m> are integers with no common factors (so <m>m=2</m> and <m>n=5</m> is fine, but <m>m=2</m> and <m>n=4</m> is not). We can rewrite this explicit function implicitly as <m>y^n = x^m</m>. Now apply implicit differentiation.

        <mrow>n\cdot y^{n-1}\cdot y' \amp = m\cdot x^{m-1}</mrow>
        <mrow>y'\amp = \frac{m}{n} \frac{x^{m-1}}{y^{n-1}}\amp\amp\text{(now substitute }x^{m/n}\text{ for }y\text{)}</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp = \frac{m}{n} \frac{x^{m-1}}{(x^{m/n})^{n-1}}\amp\amp\text{(apply lots of algebra)}</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp = \frac{m}n x^{(m-n)/n}</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp = \frac{m}n x^{m/n -1}.</mrow>
      </md>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      The above derivation is the key to the proof extending the <xref text="title" ref="thm_PowerRule" /> to rational powers. Using limits, we can extend this once more to include <em>all</em> powers, including irrational (even transcendental!) powers, giving the following theorem.
    </p>
    <theorem xml:id="thm_finalpower">

        <p>
          Let <m>f(x) = x^n</m>, where <m>n\neq 0</m> is a real number. Then <m>f</m> is a differentiable function, and <m>\fp(x) = n\cdot x^{n-1}</m>.<idx><h>derivative</h>Power Rule</idx><idx><h>Power Rule</h>differentiation</idx>
        </p>

    </theorem>
    <p>
      This theorem allows us to say the derivative of <m>x^\pi</m> is <m>\pi x^{\pi -1}</m>.

    <title>Implicit Differentiation and the Second Derivative</title>

      We can use implicit differentiation to find higher order derivatives. In theory, this is simple: first find <m>\lz{y}{x}</m>, then take its derivative with respect to <m>x</m>. In practice, it is not hard, but it often requires a bit of algebra. We demonstrate this in an example.

          While this is not a particularly simple expression, it is usable. We can see that <m>y''&gt;0</m> when <m>y\lt 0</m> and <m>y''\lt 0</m> when <m>y&gt;0</m>. In <xref ref="sec_concavity">Section</xref>, we will see how this relates to the shape of the graph.
        </p>
        <p>
          Also, if we remember that we are only considering points on the curve <m>x^2+y^2=1</m>, then we know that <m>x^2=1-y^2</m>. So we can replace the <m>x^2</m> in the expression for <m>y''</m> to get
          <me>y''=-\frac{y+\left(1-y^2\right)/y}{y^2}=-\frac{1}{y^3}</me>
        which is a simpler expression. Recognizing when simplifications like this are possible is not always easy.

    <title>Logarithmic Differentiation</title>

      Consider the function <m>y=x^x</m>; it is graphed in <xref ref="fig_logdiffa">Figure</xref>. It is well-defined for <m>x&gt;0</m> and we might be interested in finding equations of lines tangent and normal to its graph.<fn>In calculus the expression <m>0^0</m> is also considered well-defined and equal to <m>1</m>. This is easily confused with a limit of the <em>form</em> <m>0^0</m>, which is indeterminate. We skirt the issue here.</fn> How do we take its derivative?<idx><h>logarithmic differentiation</h></idx>

      The function is not a power function: it has a <q>power</q> of <m>x</m>, not a constant. It is not an exponential function either: it has a <q>base</q> of <m>x</m>, not a constant.

      A differentiation technique known as <term>logarithmic differentiation</term> becomes useful here. The basic principle is this: take the natural log of both sides of an equation <m>y=f(x)</m>, then use implicit differentiation to find <m>y'</m>. We demonstrate this in the following example.

          As suggested above, we start by taking the natural log of both sides then applying implicit differentiation.

          To <q>test</q> our answer, let's use it to find the equation of the tangent line at <m>x=1.5</m>. The point on the graph our tangent line must pass through is <m>\left(1.5, 1.5^{1.5}\right) \approx (1.5, 1.837)</m>. Using the equation for <m>y'</m>, we find the slope as
          <me>
            y' = 1.5^{1.5}\left(\ln(1.5) +1\right) \approx 1.837(1.405) \approx 2.582.

      Implicit differentiation proves to be useful as it allows us to find the instantaneous rates of change of a variety of functions. In particular, it extended the <xref text="title" ref="thm_finalpower" /> to rational exponents, which we then extended to all real numbers. In <xref ref="sec_deriv_inverse_function">Section</xref>, implicit differentiation will be used to find the derivatives of <term>inverse</term> functions, such as <m>y=\sin^{-1}(x)</m>.
