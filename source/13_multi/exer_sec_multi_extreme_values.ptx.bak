        Explain what it means to “solve a constrained optimization” problem.

    </statement>
    <answer>
      <p>
        Answers will vary. A good answer will state that we are optimizing a function subject to a constraint, or limit, on the domain of the function. We are looking to maximize/minimize the function while “looking” at only a certain part of the domain.

      </statement>
      <answer>
        <p>
          The region has no “corners” or “vertices,” just a smooth edge.To find critical points along the circle <m>x^2+y^2=4</m>, we solve for <m>y^2</m>: <m>y^2=4-x^2</m>. We can go further and state <m>y=\pm \sqrt{4-x^2}</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          We can rewrite <m>f</m> as <m>f(x)=x^2+2x + (4-x^2) + 2\sqrt{4-x^2} = 2x+4+2\sqrt{4-x^2}</m>. (We will return and use <m>-\sqrt{4-x^2}</m> later.) Solving <m>f\,^{\prime }(x)=0</m>, we get <m>x=\sqrt{2} \Rightarrow y=\sqrt{2}</m>. <m>f\,^{\prime }(x)</m> is also undefined at <m>x=\pm 2</m>, where <m>y=0</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Using <m>y=-\sqrt{4-x^2}</m>, we rewrite <m>f(x,y)</m> as <m>f(x) = 2x+4-2\sqrt{4-x^2}</m>. Solving <m>f\,^{\prime }(x) =0</m>, we get <m>x=-\sqrt{2},\ y=-\sqrt{2}</m>. Again, <m>f\,^{\prime }(x)</m> is undefined at <m>x=\pm 2</m>.

      <answer>
        <p>
          The region has two “corners” at <m>(-1,-1)</m> and <m>(1,1)</m>.Along the line <m>y=x</m>, <m>f(x,y)</m> becomes <m>f(x) = 3x-2x^2</m>. Along this line, we have a critical point at <m>(3/4,3/4)</m>.Along the curve <m>y=x^2+x-1</m>, <m>f(x,y)</m> becomes <m>f(x) =x^2+3x-3</m>. There is a critical point along this curve at <m>(-3/2, -1/4)</m>. Since <m>x=-3/2</m> lies outside our bounded region, we ignore this critical point.The function <m>f</m> itself has no critical points.Checking the value of <m>f</m> at <m>(-1,-1)</m>, <m>(1,1)</m>, <m>(3/4,3/4)</m>, we find the absolute maximum is at <m>(3/4,3/4,9/8)</m> and the absolute minimum is at <m>(-1,-1,-5)</m>.
