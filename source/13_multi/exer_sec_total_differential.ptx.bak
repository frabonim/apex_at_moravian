          A cylindrical storage tank is to be 2ft tall with a radius of 1ft. Is the volume of the tank more sensitive to changes in the radius or the height?
          </p>
      </statement>
      <answer>
        <p>
          The total differential of volume is <m>dV = 4\pi dr + \pi dh</m>. The coefficient of <m>dr</m> is greater than the coefficient of <m>dh</m>, so the volume is more sensitive to changes in the radius.

          <em>Projectile Motion:</em> The <m>x</m>-value of an object moving under the principles of projectile motion is <m>x(\theta ,v_0,t)= (v_0\cos \theta )t</m>. A particular projectile is fired with an initial velocity of <m>v_0=250</m>ft/s and an angle of elevation of <m>\theta = 60^\circ </m>. It travels a distance of <m>375</m>ft in 3 seconds.Is the projectile more sensitive to errors in initial speed or angle of elevation?</p>
      </statement>
      <answer>
        <p>
          Distance of the projectile is a function of two variables (leaving <m>t=3</m>): <m>D(v_0,\theta ) = 3v_0\cos \theta </m>. The total differential of <m>D</m> is <m>dD = 3\cos \theta dv_0-3v_0\sin \theta d\theta </m>. The coefficient of <m>d\theta </m> has a much greater magnitude than the coefficient of <m>dv_0</m>, so a small change in the angle of elevation has a much greater effect on distance traveled than a small change in initial velocity.

      <answer>
        <p>
          Using trigonometry, <m>\ell = x\tan \theta </m>, so <m>d\ell = \tan \theta dx + x\sec ^2\theta d\theta </m>. With <m>\theta = 85^\circ </m> and <m>x=30</m>, we have <m>d\ell = 11.43dx+3949.38d\theta </m>. The measured length of the wall is much more sensitive to errors in <m>\theta </m> than in <m>x</m>. While it can be difficult to compare sensitivities between measuring feet and measuring degrees (it is somewhat like “comparing apples to oranges”), here the coefficients are so different that the result is clear: a small error in degree has a much greater impact than a small error in distance.

        <p>
          It is “common sense” that it is far better to measure a long distance with a long measuring tape rather than a short one. A measured distance <m>D</m> can be viewed as the product of the length <m>\ell </m> of a measuring tape times the number <m>n</m> of times it was used. For instance, using a 3' tape 10 times gives a length of 30'. To measure the same distance with a 12' tape, we would use the tape 2.5 times. (I.e., <m>30=12\times 2.5</m>.) Thus <m>D = n\ell </m>.Suppose each time a measurement is taken with the tape, the recorded distance is within 1/16” of the actual distance. (I.e., <m>d\ell = 1/16^{\prime \prime } \approx 0.005</m>ft). Using differentials, show why common sense proves correct in that it is better to use a long tape to measure long distances.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <answer>
        <p>
          With <m>D = n\ell </m>, the total differential is <m>dD = \ell \, dn+ n\,d\ell .</m> If one measures with a short tape, <m>n</m> must be large and hence <m>n\,d\ell </m> is going to be greater than when a large tape is used (wherein <m>n</m> will be small).
