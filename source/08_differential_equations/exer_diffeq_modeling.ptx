          A feature of radioactive decay is that the amount of a radioactive substance decreases at a rate proportional to the current amount of the substance. The <em>half life</em> of a substance is the amount of time it takes for half of a given amount of substance to decay. The half life of carbon-14 is approximately 5730 years. If an ancient object has a carbon-14 amount that is 20% of the original amount, how old is the object?

          A stream flows into a pond containing <m>2</m> million gallons of fresh water at a rate of <m>1</m> million gallons per day. The stream flows out of the first pond and into a second pond containing <m>3</m> million gallons of fresh water. The stream then flows out of the second pond. Suppose the inflow and outflow rates are the same so that both ponds maintain their volumes. A factory upstream of the first pond starts polluting the stream. Directly below the factory, pollutant has a concentration of <m>55</m> grams per million gallons, and this concentration starts to flow into the first pond. Find the concentration of pollutant in the first and second ponds at five days.
